# Readme-Generator

## Description
I ceated a command-line application that accepts user input to generate a readme file. This was done by using Node.js. I created the code using javascript and by using the NPM inquirer.

## Installation
<li>Open the files in Visual Studio Code
<li>Open the Terminal
<li>Type node index.js and hit enter
<li>Answer the questions or prompts to create the entries for the README file
<li>Once the final details have been entered, then the README file will be created into the output folder to view and save
<li>When a user enters the project title, it's displayed as the title of the README
<li>When a user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
<li>When a user chooses a license for their application from a list of options, a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under.
<li>When a user enters their GitHub username, it's added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to their GitHub profile
<li>When a user enters their email address, it's added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach them with additional questions.
<li>When a user clicks on the links in the Table of Contents, they are taken to the corresponding section of the README
